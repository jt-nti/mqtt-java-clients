mqtt-java-clients
=================

A while ago I hacked about with the JavaME code to get something working but I seem to have lost it. At some point I'd still like to get an MQTT client working for my old phone.

This is just fork of the [Eclipse Paho] [1] project to experiment with a better way to get a JavaME client building from the same source.
